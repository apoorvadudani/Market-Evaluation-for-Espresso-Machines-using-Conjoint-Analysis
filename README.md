# Market-Evaluation-for-Espresso-Machines-using-Conjoint-Analysis

## Background

## Attribute Selection

In attribute selection, I select characteristics (attributes) that consumers find most relevant when evaluating a product or service. I first research secondary information, such as product reviews, and then conduct primary research, such as customer surveys, to identify 3 relevant attributes:
- Speed (the length of time in minutes it takes someone to brew a cup of coffee)
- Capacity (the number of cups of espresso the machine can brew at one time) 
- Price (the retail price of the espresso machine).
