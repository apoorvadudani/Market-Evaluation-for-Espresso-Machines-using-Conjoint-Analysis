# Market-Evaluation-for-Espresso-Machines-using-Conjoint-Analysis

## Background

Acme Espresso Machines is a small, fictitious manufacturer of premium coffee maker machines and is in a market dominated by
several large manufacturers, including Breville, DeLonghi, Gaggia, and Rancilio. To improve Acme’s market share, I plan to analyze the market with several objectives in mind:

- Identify specific market segments within the greater market
- Identify specific features desired by different market segments
- Select marketing messages that will resonate with market segments
- Estimate market share performance for different types of machines

## Data analysis method

I plan to conduct a conjoint analysis to address the objectives, because  

I use a 10-step procedure as follows. 

## Attribute Selection

In attribute selection, I select characteristics (attributes) that consumers find most relevant when evaluating a product or service. I first research secondary information, such as product reviews, and then conduct primary research, such as customer surveys, to identify 3 relevant attributes:

- Speed (the length of time in minutes it takes someone to brew a cup of coffee)
- Capacity (the number of cups of espresso the machine can brew at one time) 
- Price (the retail price of the espresso machine).

## Attribute Level Selection

In the next step, I leverage secondary and primary research to identify the levels of the attributes where consumers perceive distinct differences. In Acme’s case, I identify two levels for each attribute: 

-Speed: S1: “Fast” (machine capable of brewing coffee in under one minute)
-Speed: S2: “Slow” (machine requires 1 minute or more to brew coffee)
-Capacity: C1: “Single-Cup” (machine makes 1 cup of espresso at a time)
-Capacity: C2: “Multi-Cup” (machines makes multiple cups at a time)
-Price: P1: “Budget” (machine price under $300)
-Price: P2: “Premium” (machine price $300 or more)

## Product Bundle Formation

I create candidate products by bundling together the three attributes I selected, and varying the levels of the attributes. Some marketer researchers call the bundles “cards” because the attributes are written down on physical cards (like 3” x 5” index cards) to show to respondents. In this case, I have 3 attributes of 2 levels each, so I will need 2^3 cards, or 8 cards. The cards are listed in the table below (and can also be found in . Note how every combination of attributes is represented in the table.
